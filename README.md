# Round-Robin
Round-Robin job distribution system simulation written in using JDK in my second year at university as part of my degree

****
PLEASE NOTE
**** 
This project was developed and tested in the netbeans IDE and therefore does currenltly need to be run from an IDE. This will be able to be directly executed from the files in the future


Order of use:
1. Open and run the LoadBalancer
2. Open and connect as many nodes as you wish using the NodeSystem (there is no limit to this as of testing)
3. Open and connect the UserClient 
4. Use the UserClient to control the system 


This was my first larger project using Java and Datagram moduels so code may be inefficient or lacking in some areas, however i may come back to improve this in the future, for now it is free for anyone to use to learn from or to use as a framework for their own projects.
